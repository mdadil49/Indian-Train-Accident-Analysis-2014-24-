### Data Collection
- The data used in this analysis was sourced from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org) and covers train accidents in India between 2014 and 2024.
- The dataset includes information such as:
  - Year of the accident
  - State where the accident occurred
  - Number of fatalities
  - Number of injured

### Data Cleaning
- The raw data was cleaned using **Microsoft Excel**.
- Steps taken include:
  - Handling missing data
  - Removing duplicates
  - Structuring the data into relevant columns (state, year, number of accidents, fatalities, injuries).

### Analysis
- **Power BI** was used for the analysis and visualization.
- The analysis highlights:
  - The top 10 states with the highest number of train accidents.
  - The sum of injuries and fatalities per year.
  - Year-over-year trends in accident rates.
  
### Visualizations
Two key visualizations were created:
1. **Top 10 States with Highest Train Accidents**:
   - Odisha and Uttar Pradesh were the states with the highest number of accidents.
   - These two states alone accounted for a large percentage of the total accidents during the 2014-2024 period.
   
2. **Sum of Injuries and Fatalities by Year**:
   - 2022 had the highest number of injuries, followed by 2014 and 2016.
   - There was a noticeable spike in fatalities in 2022.

### Conclusion
- **Odisha** and **Uttar Pradesh** are the most accident-prone states, with significantly higher accident rates compared to others.
- There are fluctuations in the number of injuries and fatalities, with 2022 being the worst year in terms of casualties.
- This analysis provides valuable insights for railway authorities to focus on accident-prone areas and improve safety measures.
